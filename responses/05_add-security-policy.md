## Welcome!

In this lab, you'll get some practice setting up a security policy and then you'll see it in action!


## Step 1: Add a SECURITY.md file

1. Navigate to the [Security]({{ repoUrl }}/network/alerts) tab
1. Click on Security Policy located in the left sidebar
1. Click the **Start Setup** button
1. Commit the template security policy to the new branch as selected `{{ user.username }}-patch-1`
1. Commit the new file and create the pull request

Alternatively, you could also create a new file in the root directory called `SECURITY.md`, write up a quick security policy, and open a pull request.
