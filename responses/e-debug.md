It looks like you opened a pull request, as I expected, but didn't include the proper file.

To set up a security policy, please include a `SECURITY.md` file in one of the following paths:
- `SECURITY.md` in the root directory of your repository
- `docs/SECURITY.md`
- `.github/SECURITY.md`

I'll respond when I detect a new push to this pull request.
